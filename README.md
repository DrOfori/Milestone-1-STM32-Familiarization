<br />In this Milestone 1, we will be making the LED on the STM32 board to blink in order to familiarize with the development board.
<br />To make the blink very obvious, we chooose 1000 ms as the delay to show the blinking process.
<br /> Steps to make Blinky
<br /> 1.Connect the development board to any PC with STM32CubeIDE running in the background
<br /> 2.Set Pin 5 as the GP_IO 
<br /> 3. At While Loop, the Delay is set to 1000ms to show delay is executing for the LED.
<br /> 4. Lastly, the main program is hard coded into the development board and Blinky can now be shown at anywhere as long as power source are connected.
